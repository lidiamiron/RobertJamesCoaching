                                <p class="card-text fs-4 fw-light  ">My struggle with OCD and anxiety started at college when I was 17. Life back then was something to be tolerated. I was low on confidence, depressed, anxious and more often than not drunk. But fortunately for me I found a way through and in my late twenties I started to find out about anxiety and what I could do to beat it. Well it turned out paradoxically that trying to ´beat it´ was in fact part of the problem. The most important word I came across in my recovery was acceptance. But as i´m sure you´re aware telling people to accept their anxiety is fine in theory, but in reality it can be extremely hard for someone with anxiety to just ´accept it´. That´s exactly how I felt so I decided to start practicing acceptance by putting myself in situations I was afraid of.</p>

This well researched and incredibly effective approach to anxiety management blends cognitive behaviour therapy and mindfulness. Through the practice of meditation you can learn to accept anxiety and have a different relationship with it. This has been the cornerstone of my recovery from anxiety. You will then work with me to identify your values and commit to gently refocusing your attention onto them each time you catch yourself worrying or ruminating. To find out more, check out the blog on ACT.</p>

He was quick to respond and so very kind. He taught me a little about acceptance and commitment of my condition. When you are dealing with such heavy emotions, you need someone compassionate and kind to help guide you and I believe Robert is just that.</p>

                  <p class="card-text text-center">First of all I would like to mention straight away that Robert is a great coach who within 3 sessions managed to help me immensely! 
                    I found Robert by going through instagram believing my mind that something is not right with me. Anxiety, intrusive thoughts and a ruminating mind was something new to me and did not know where to start. Luckily Robert’s honest post and the passion for outdoor sport caught my attention.
                    I was quite excited to visit his web site in the hope that he is the one with the “magical” cure to heal me.</p>

                  <p class="card-text text-center">'For me, it was really helpful to speak to someone who could genuinely empathise with how I was feeling. Rob was able to call me out on certain behaviours that I hadn’t even realised were compulsive, and I believe this is because he’d worked through similar experiences himself. I also really like the way his approach is holistic in nature; he’s open to alternative ideas and incorporating other aspects of wellbeing into the treatment plan - exercise and meditation, for example. Rob also encouraged me to take a values-driven approach, which has really helped me in making my own judgments about the appropriate action to take in more testing moments. </p>

I had done ERP many times before but acceptance therapy was new to me and Rob explained it well and helped me implement it in a practical way. The big game changer and one I will be eternally grateful for was Rob introducing me to the WHM. </p>

He shared his experience and skills, this gave me the energy I needed to move forward. I gained a lot of insight on ACT and ERP methods that Rob taught me and I really appreciated him reaching out with specific exercises for my type of OCD. Rob brings a calm and positive energy and I highly recommend working with him.</p>
